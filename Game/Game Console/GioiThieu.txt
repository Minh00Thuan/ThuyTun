Escaping nights without you with shadows on the wall
My mind is running wild tryin hard not to fall 
You told me that you love me but say I'm just a friend 
my heart is broken up into pieces 
Cos i know I'll never free my soul 
it's trapped between true love and being alone 
When my eyes are closed the greatest story told 
I woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor 
Why oh why tell me why not me 
Why oh why we were meant to be 
Baby I know I could be all you need 
Why oh why oh why 
I wanna love you 
if you only knew how much I love you 
So why not me 
The day after tomorrow I'll still be around 
To catch you when you fall and ever let you down 
you say that we're forever our love will never end 
I've tried to come up but it's drowning me to know 
you'll never feel my soul 
It's trapped between true love and being alone 
when my eyes are closed the greatest story told 
i woke and my dreams are shattered here on the floor 
Tell me baby... 
You won't ever know 
How far we can go 
You won't ever know 
How far we can go (go)
